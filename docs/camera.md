# Camera
Toolbox includes several features that interact with the game's camera, allowing you to view the world from different perspectives. All camera functions can be accessed via [chat commands](commands).

## Camera Unlock
* Typing `/cam unlock` or `/camera unlock` allows you to freely move your point of view around the map without moving your character.
* Typing `/cam lock` or `/camera lock` locks the camera again and returns your view to your character.

## Movement
While the camera is unlocked:
* Use the **horizontal axis** controls to move the camera across the ground plane:  
  `W` (forward), `E` or `D` (strafe right), `S` (backward), `Q` or `A` (strafe left).
* Use the **vertical axis** controls to move the camera up and down:  
  `Z` (up) and `X` (down).
* Hold the **right mouse button** to pan and tilt the camera using the mouse.
* Press `R` to move forward automatically until cancelled by pressing `W` or `S`.

## Other Features
* `/cam fog on` or `/cam fog off` enables or disables fog.
* `/cam speed #` adjusts the camera movement speed. The default value is 100.
